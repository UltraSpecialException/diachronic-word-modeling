Tracking Sense Gains and Losses and Measure Degree of Lexical Semantic Change (code, data and results for research project)

This repository contains the code (see the 2 .ipynb files), data and paper for the research project for CSC2611: Computational Models of Semantic Change at the University of Toronto.

In this work, we investigate how senses of words are used with varying frequencies at different periods of time in history and examine a method of computing these frequencies in the interest of detecting sense gains or losses.

Furthermore, we extend on previous works of using diachronic word embeddings to measure degrees of lexical semantic change.
